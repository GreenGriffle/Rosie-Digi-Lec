## The hat of ridiculous permission

This hat became a great playground for testing ways in which I could try to combine my design practice with my interests. I've always loved costume, and 
wearables. I'm also very interested in moments when people use costume to put down the usual social norms. So this hat ticked all those boxes. This also became one of the main projects I spoke about in my end of year review, and I wrote about the concepts I was exploring in my writtting class "Design Criticism"


## Project goals. 

The goal of the project was to take the musical hat from the first project and push it further. I wanted to experiment with a different 
sort of capacitive sensor, the Touche sheild, which used fequency sweeping to sense different sorts of touch.  I also wanted
to explore different ways of making the music with Arduino.  

## How project developed. 

The project moved forwards in three directions at once. This allowed me to keep the exploratory path open, which insuring I actually had something to show at the end. 

1. Exploring the Touche sheild. Trying to get different sorts of touch reconised. 
  * This involved building a touche sheild and using a gameduino sheild following this tutorial: http://www.instructables.com/id/Singing-plant-Make-your-plant-sing-with-Arduino-/

2. Exploring the AdaFruit music sheild.

3. Exploring Minim.

4. Building an attractive hat to encourage people to want to wear it.

5. Exploring even more while making a tech glove for people with arthritis for studio class. 

## Chosen Final Ingredients

*   Adafruit BNO055 Absolute Orientation Sensor
*   Arduino Uno.
*   Copper.
*   Minim.



Work in progress!! I' m hoping you never read this, as I will get it done before you start marking. I'm running some videos through premier to make
them smaller and its taking a while.
