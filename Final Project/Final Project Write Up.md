## The hat of ridiculous permission

This hat became a great playground for testing ways in which I could try to combine my design practice with my interests. I've always loved costume, and 
wearables. I'm also very interested in moments when people use costume to put down the usual social norms. So this hat ticked all those boxes.


## Project goals. 

The goal of the project was to take the musical hat from the first project and push it further. I wanted to experiment with a different 
sort of capacitive sensor, the Touche sheild, which used fequency sweeping to sense different sorts of touch.  I also wanted
to explore different ways of making the music with Arduino.  









Work in progress!! I' m hoping you never read this, as I will get it done before you start marking. I'm running some videos through premier to make
them smaller and its taking a while.
