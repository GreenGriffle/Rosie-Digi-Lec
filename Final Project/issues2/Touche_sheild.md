I'm trying to turn this project into a musical instrument:

This is the link to all his code: 

https://github.com/Illutron/AdvancedTouchSensing

My interest is in trying to make a muscial instument that responds to different sorts of touch. The idea is its a capaitive sensor that uses 
a frquency sweep to sense different sorts of touch. I've included my code that I tryed to use minim and "value x" and "valueY" but it only
made one sound. Idealy it would be good to have one sound for "in water", one for "touch" and one for "grab"
