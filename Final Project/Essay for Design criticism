## The hat of Reduculous Permission
### Essay I wrote about hat project. 



We need costumes and games to give us permission to put down our usual way of behaving. Costumes and game props physically show that this is a different state. Within the confines of a game it becomes safe to be ridiculous. Everyone is happy to play a game if they understand the rules, and feel comfortable that everyone is invested in playing the game. There is great importance in this sanctified freedom.  
 
The hat of ridiculous permission is a crude prototype of a bigger idea. Can we encourage users to give themselves permission to be ridiculous? And can this ridiculous state be used to question and redefine our regular behaviour? 
The prototype is a hat that encourages the user to move in a ridiculous manner in order to get a musical reward. When people wear it they cannot help but move in free and unnatural ways, they willingly bang, lunge, and twist. They enjoy it, they become present and engaged in the act. The hat is both a costume and a game. 
Here is the scene: The user is presented with a shiny bicycle hat covered in wires. They must use blue tape to afix a small piece of tin foil to their face, without this it will not function. When the wearer makes certain movements they are rewarded with a crude sound. They can either twist, bow or tilt their head. Each movement must be reasonably large to get a sound reward. Subtle movements are not rewarded.
Following work could encourage people to make other movements with their body. A sort of several man band could be created. The social act of ridiculousness supports the notion of permission.

Social behavior ensures the stability we count on, by directing and narrowing the range of possible acts. Without these rules we are somewhat lost. We are not comfortable in expanding beyond social actions without some sort of comfortable frame work. We can use game mechanics to create an unburdened, demarcated space in which the ridiculous is the expected, rather than the ridiculed. 
We conform rigidly to social norms because we fear ridicule. We fear that deviating from expected paths will cause us to be rejected by people we respect. Things that we would like to do and explore become secrets, even to ourselves, and live in a place called “impossible” and “ridiculous”. For us to leave our place of safety we require a new set of rules to replace the safety of our usual boundaries. Putting on a costume or playing a game is a signifier that we are leaving social norms, and we are permitted to loosen our inhibitions. 

It’s not a complete free for all, it’s a more flexible, or different set of boundaries. The line before complete hedonism. Imagine David Bowie meets glittery space donkey sort of rock star.

When people wear it they cannot help but move in free and unnatural ways. 
In the figures above, you see two hats that I have made. The first is the bad move dance hat, still in progress. The 2nd is a costume hat. Mostly for the joy of making, but also for the transformable nature of wearing a costume. It is very ritualistic. It changes the way the wearer interacts with others, and how others interact with the wearer. In this way it becomes a game. 

Interactive objects and environments help us to expand / test / explore / social constructs. They allow us to do things we would not normally be comfortable doing. And in doing so observe and question why we are not normally comfortable.
When we turn off the autopilot and are invited into a parallel identity we become more engaged because everything is deemed flexible and recognized to be a series of designed choices. Objects and environments that amplify social awkwardness can cue for this kind of criticality because their existence implies a mode of query. 
Imagine if everyone in a space was wearing trousers that would explode the arse to 10 times its regular size. The trousers could be set off by any number of game triggers. When one person’s heart beat rises, or every time someone uses a certain word. As every one’s trousers would explode in this way, and as it would be totally out of proportion, no one would have anxiety. In this way, it could make the invisible psychological state become a tangible talking point. In the same way we can explore invisible psychological archetypes through myth and symbols, we could bring this into the tangible world, and explore these ideas together. It’s quite different than an individual sensing that their own arse is too big in everyday life.
Game structures can be used to temporarily replace social norms. The temporary state allows us freedom to try parallel scenarios which are unsustainable, but allow us the perspective to evaluate our usual way of functioning.   
With no game structures in play, we default to social norms. Games and costumes create a temporary space for us to inhabit, that exist outside standard rules, where we can peer into the bubble of our cognitive biases.
