# Sensor Reasearch

I've heard of all these sensors before. But it was interesting to learn of a few particularities.

# Photocells

No beginner's guide to arduino would be complete without a Photocell! They are sensors that change resistance based on light. 
They are very inconsistent, even if you get 10 photocells from the same batch, you are likely to get different results. 

# FSRs

These sensors sense physical pressure. They only give a range of values and cannot be trusted for a specific pressure, 
or sort of touch (eg. The exact difference between a light or hard touch). They are cheap however, 
so get for a simple, yes, this has been poked. The way they work is a layer of sensing material against a non conductive material, more pressure 
lowers the resistance of the conductive material. 
Similar to the ideas on the “how to get what you want website” There are several do it your self pressure sensors that work on this theory.  This one is a nice one:

# Tilt sensors

### I learnt that tilt sensors actually work the opposite of how I imagined! I imagined that there was a conductive ball that rolls
and joins an open circuit. It is actually the opposite, a non conductive ball or liquid breaks the circuit. They are super simple and reasonably easy to use. 


# Extra interesting sensors:

I've not seen these before - capacitive force sensors, claiming accuracy to 1%:

# Next level bend sensor!

This shiny tail like thing can sense the bend, and shape!
