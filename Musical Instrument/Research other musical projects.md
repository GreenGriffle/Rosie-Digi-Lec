###Using coo coo clock parts. I saw a later version of this instument at the maker fair last year. He had many more coo coo bellows, 
better arranged, making better music:

###Instument made out of a building. This was at the round house in London by David Byrne. It was an organ that was connected to beaters and 
pipes that played the building. The artist said it made a level playing field, as no one was able to play the instument well.
